version: '3.9'
# version of docker-compose syntax that we're using

# can have multiple services in the docker-compose 
# for your app
services:
  app:
    # name of our service this is just the service that 
    # is going to run our dockerfile

    build:
      # we want to build our dockerfile inside our current directory
      context: .

    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
      # Maps port 8000 of the host to port 8000 of the container

    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
      # Mounts the ./app directory from the host into the /app directory of the container

    command: >
      sh -c "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    # Specifies the command to be executed when the container starts
    # In this case, it runs the Django development server and binds it to 0.0.0.0:8000

    # We can override the last part "command", by specifying our 
    # own command we run "docker compose run"
